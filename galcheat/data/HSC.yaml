# The link is for Suprime-Cam, which should be approximately
# okay. Here is the updated version for HSC as of July 2021
# https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/hsc_etc_report.html. We
# could update the numbers to this version, although we need to
# convert the unit from ADU/sec to mag/arcsec^2.
#
# zeropoint
# The zeropoints are inhereted from WeakLensingDeblending
# (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/descwl/survey.py#L315).
# In WeakLensingDeblending, a zeropoint is defined with respect to mag = 24 as
# flux = exp_time * Z_{24} * 10^(-0.4 * (mag-24))
# , but here we converted it to a more useful convention
# flux = exp_time * 10^(-0.4 * (mag-Z))
# . Note that is assumes an atmosphere airmass of 1.2.
# We found that our zeropoints are close to the ones in the Subaru
# website (see mag for 1e-/s in
# https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/sensitivity.html).
# Note:
# The zeropoints in WeakLensingDeblending used the speclite package
# (https://github.com/desihub/speclite), where they seemed to use the
# official filter responses
# (https://speclite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters.html#hsc-filters)
# and convolved them with a reference magnitude
# (https://speclite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/speclite.filters.ab_reference_flux.html#speclite.filters.ab_reference_flux)
# to obtain the zeropoints.
